ChromeNewTab
============

A chrome extension that replaces the new tab.  
## Plugins
Plugins are `eval`'d both in the options page, and in the main page. Use the `identity` variable to detect where it is executed, and run code based on that.
## Riot API
This API is used in the [/plugins/lol.js](https://github.com/slak44/ChromeNewTab/blob/master/plugins/lol.js) file.
### Statement

### API Key
In order to use the LoL functionality, a valid Riot API key must be provided in the settings page.
### League data
The button will not work if the GET request returned with 503(server at capacity; wait) or 429(rate limit reached, too many requests; wait). Effectively any other response than 200(obviously) will cause the button to not function.

This API is used in the [/plugins/reddit.js](https://github.com/slak44/ChromeNewTab/tree/master/plugins/reddit.js) file.  
The page will perform GET requests for the user data associated with the given username.
